## How to migrate from discord.py v1 to v2

As of 18.08.2022 this repo is based on discord.py v2.

Only changes needed are updating your cogs and ensuring that all privileged intents are enabled for your bot.

You can find the privileged intents guide here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html?highlight=intents#privileged-intents

You can see the migration instructions for your cogs here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html

## How to run

- Copy `robocop_ng/config_template.py` to `robocop_ng/config.py` and **configure all necessary parts for your server**.
- Enable all privileged intents ([guide here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html?highlight=intents#privileged-intents)) for the bot. You don't need to give Discord your passport as Ryuko-NG is not designed to run in >1 guild at once, let alone >100.
- Add the bot to your guild. There are many resources about this online.
- If you haven't already done this already, **move the bot's role above the roles it'll need to manage, or else it won't function properly**, this is especially important for verification as it doesn't work otherwise.
- If you're moving from Kurisu or Robocop: Follow [Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop](https://github.com/Ryujinx/ryuko-ng#tips-for-people-moving-from-kurisurobocop) below.

### Running with docker

- `docker build . -t robocopng`
- Assuming your robocop-ng repo is on `~/docker/`: `docker run --restart=always -v ~/docker/robocop-ng:/usr/src/app --name robocop_ng robocopng:latest`

For updates, run `git pull;docker rm -f robocop_ng` then run the two commands above again.

### Running manually

- Install python3.8+.
- Install dependencies with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) using `poetry install`.
- Run `robocop_ng/__main__.py` (`cd robocop_ng;python3 __main__.py`).

To keep the bot running, you might want to use pm2 or a systemd service.

## Tips for people moving from Kurisu/Robocop

If you're moving from Kurisu/Robocop, and want to preserve your data, you'll want to do the following steps:

- Copy your `data` folder over into the `robocop_ng` folder.
- Rename your `data/warnsv2.json` file to `data/userlog.json`.
- Edit `data/restrictions.json` and replace role names (`"Muted"` etc) with role IDs (`526500080879140874` etc). Make sure to have it as int, not as str (don't wrap role id with `"` or `'`).
